- **Comprehensive CLI Interface**: Interact with SkyGEN through a user-friendly command-line interface.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zirkan/SkyGEN.git
   cd SkyGEN
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file in the project root with the following structure:

```yaml
database_path: "path/to/your/database.sqlite"
# Add other configuration options as needed
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root to store your keys securely:

```plaintext
PUBLIC_KEY_PEM="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_PEM"
PRIVATE_KEY_PEM="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM"
```

## üîß Usage

SkyGEN provides a CLI interface for various operations. Here are some example commands:

- **Encrypt a password**:
  ```bash
  python skygen.py encrypt-password
  ```

- **Encrypt a message using post-quantum cryptography**:
  ```bash
  python skygen.py encrypt-message
  ```

- **Decrypt a message**:
  ```bash
  python skygen.py decrypt-message
  ```

- **Train the anomaly detection model**:
  ```bash
  python skygen.py train-anomaly --data 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
  ```

- **Detect anomalies**:
  ```bash
  python skygen.py detect-anomalies --data 1.0 2.0 10.0 4.0 5.0
  ```

- **Create a new transaction**:
  ```bash
  python skygen.py new-transaction --sender Alice --recipient Bob --amount 10.5
  ```

- **Mine a new block**:
  ```bash
  python skygen.py mine
  ```

For more information on available commands, use:
```bash
python skygen.py --help
```
